Description: This package implements multiple imputation for multivariate data with missing and censored values under a coarsening at random assumption (Heitjan and Rubin, 1991). The multiple imputatin algorithm is based on the data augmentation algorithm proposed by Tanner and Wong (1987). The Gibbs sampling algorithm is adopted to to update the model parameters and draw imputations of the coarse data.
