#' Combined NHANES dataset from 1999-2004 NHANES study
#'
#' A dataset including the age, gender and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and 24 PCB
#' measurements.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 5874 rows and 24 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{BPXDAR}{Diastolic blood pressure}
#'   \item{RIAGENDR}{Gender, 1 = male, 2 = female}
#'   \item{RIDAGEYR}{Age in years}
#'   \item{BMXBMI}{Body mass index}
#' }
#'
#' @details The dataset is combined from the NHANES release cycles 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004. Almost
#' all PCB have both the missing and censored values as falling below the limits of detection (LODs). The dataset include
#' two components, the first component is the observed NHANES data where the censored PCB measurements are replaced
#' by the LODs dividing the square root of 2. The second component is a data frame including the censoring indicators
#' of the data, in that data frame, 0 indicates an observed PCB measurement, 1 indicates a censored PCB measurement, and `NA` indicates
#' a missing PCB measurement.
#'
#' @note The subset provided here was selected to demonstrate the functionality of the mvnimpute package,
#' no clinical conclusions should be derived from it.
