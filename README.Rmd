The goal of **mvnimpute** package is to implement multiple imputation to the data when there are both missing and censored values (a single variable can have both missing and censored values simultaneously; or it can have either only missing or censored values). An example of application of this package is for imputing the NHANES laboratory measurement data that are subject to limits of detection (LODs).


## Installation

For Windows users, the Rtools for building R packages have to be installed according to your R version from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html.

### From GitHub

**NOTE: Some of the packages this package depends on may require the latest version of R, it is recommended to update your R software to the latest version**. You can install **mvnimpute** package in its development version from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

#### For first-time users
``` r
# install the development package devtools for installing packages from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")

# install mvnimpute package with vignette from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hli226/mvnimpute", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

`build_vignettes = TRUE` argument is added for including the vignettes, which give the step-by-step instructions on how to use this package using an artificial example and a real data example. There are two vignettes file, one using the simulated data, and the other one using a selected subset of the NHANES data. You have to install the development package **devtools** for installing packages from GitHub. The packages that **mvnimpute** depends on will be automatically downloaded and installed.   

## Basic functions

It has 8 functions including 

`data.generation`: generates multivariate normal data with missing and censored values.

`param.calc`: calculates the complete-case and available-case parameters.

`visual.plot`: draws plot showing percentages of missing, censored, and observed values.

`marg.plot`: draws marginal density plot for each variable.

`multiple.imputation`: implements multiple imputation for missing and censored data, have to perform on the complete data.

`conv.plot`: draws trace plot of the parameters from the multiple imputation.

`avg.plot`: draws trace plot of the averaged values of the parameters from the multiple imputation.

`acf.calc`: calculates the autocorrelation values and draws ACF plots.

`nhanes.dat`: 2011 - 2016 NHANES demographics, PCB measurements, and heavy metal pollutants data.

For detailed instructions on using the package and a walk-through example, please refer to the vignette downloaded with the package. Once the package is installed, the vignette can be accessed using the function `browseVignettes("mvnimpute")`, it will open in an external web browser.

## Acknowlegements

This package is based on the work supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences under grant 1R01ES028790-01.
